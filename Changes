v0.3

    * Previously, template objects were reused as-is every time. This meant that
      each subsequent run built on previous modifications to the original.
      Not cool.

v0.2

    * Complete rewrite.
    * Uses DOM::Tiny now rather than XML.
    * Structures the templates into libraries of templates.
    * Provides some basic facilities for locating original source files.

v0.1

    * Initial experimental release.
